## Note on SQL Query for Finding Nearest Stations

I created the following SQL query for PostgreSQL to find the nearest stations within a specified radius for a given company:

```typescript
async findNearestStationsWithinRadiusForCompany({ companyId, latitude, longitude, radiusKilometers }: SearchQuery): Promise<StationModelDB[]> {
  const radiusMeters = Number(radiusKilometers) * 1000;
  const result = await prisma.$queryRaw<StationModelDB[]>`
    WITH RECURSIVE company_hierarchy AS (
      SELECT id, name, parent_id
      FROM "Company"
      WHERE id = ${companyId}
      UNION ALL
      SELECT c.id, c.name, c.parent_id
      FROM "Company" c
      INNER JOIN company_hierarchy ch ON c.parent_id = ch.id
    )
    SELECT s.*, ROUND(earth_distance(ll_to_earth(${Number(latitude)},${Number(longitude)}), ll_to_earth(latitude, longitude))::NUMERIC, 2) AS distance
    FROM "Station" AS s
    JOIN company_hierarchy ch ON s.company_id = ch.id
    WHERE
      earth_box(ll_to_earth(${Number(latitude)}, ${Number(longitude)}), ${radiusMeters}) @> ll_to_earth(latitude, longitude)
      AND earth_distance(ll_to_earth(${Number(latitude)}, ${Number(longitude)}), ll_to_earth(latitude, longitude)) < ${radiusMeters}
    ORDER BY
      distance;
  `;
  return result;
}
```
Reasons for Using This Approach
As PostgreSQL doesnâ€™t have a data type for 3D points, the cube data type is used to represent 3D cubes. Points are represented as zero-sized cubes, which is both simple and efficient. A domain-specific type, earth, is defined as a descendant of the cube type, incorporating additional sanity checks (e.g., ensuring the point is close to the planet's surface).

Here are some useful functions that justify this approach:
- ll_to_earth(latitude, longitude): Translates a latitude and longitude pair into the earth type, calculating the 3D point location.
- earth_distance(point1, point2): Computes the distance between two points in the earth format.
- earth_box(point, radius): Creates a bounding cube to contain all points within a specified radius from a given point. This cube is an approximation, but it can be used for efficient searching with the @> (containment) operator, which supports GIST indexes.
This method offers several advantages, such as speed, simplicity, and the ability to redefine the planet's radius (useful for non-Earth calculations or re-defining units of measurement).
